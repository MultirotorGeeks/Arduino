LIBRARY NAME:

  GyroKalman
  
AUTHOR:

DESCRIPTION:

  This GyroKalman project provides X, Y, and Z axis gyroscopic kalman filter
  classes.  Each independent class provides the ability to run kalman filter
  on the position of a free body in space, with roll and roll rate about
  the respective axis as the estimated states.
  
  See the header file GyroKalman.h for descriptions of each of the public 
  functions provided in the GyroKalman class, and how they are used.

DEPENDENCIES:

  avrfix
  
LIBRARY PROJECT SETUP:

  This project was created using Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers (version
  4.4.1), with the AVR Eclipse plugin (version 2.4.1) installed.
  
  To create this project, click on File->New->C++ Project... and then enter
  GyroKalman as the project name and select the directory containing this 
  README file as the project location.  Assuming you have checked this out from
  a local git repository cloned from https://github.com/pmrancuret/Arduino, 
  this path should be <YourPathToGitRepoLoc>\Arduino\libraries\GyroKalman.  
  
  Then, under 'Project Type', select 'Empty Project' under the 'AVR Cross 
  Target Static Library' type, and ensure AVR-GCC is selected as the toolchain.  
  Click 'Next', then un-select the 'Debug' build configuration if you don't use
  it, and click 'Next' again.  Finally, enter the correct processor type and 
  clock speed you are using, and click Finish.  For the ArduPilot board, the
  processor type is ATmega328p, and the clock speed is 16000000.
  
  Once the project is created, ensure the path for finding the avrfix.h file
  is added.  To do this, right click the project and select Properties.  Then, 
  expand the C/C++ build submenu on the left and click on 'Settings.'  In the 
  right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand both the 'AVR Compiler' and
  the 'AVR C++ Compiler' submenus.  Under each of these, select Directories, 
  then click the 'Add...' button at the top right (with the green + sign).  In
  this dialog, enter the path to the directory containing the avrfix.h file.
  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' folder of this
  git repository, and the full repository is checked out including libraries, 
  then the following path should work for the avrfix library:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
  
  Once this project has been set up correctly, the library can be built by
  right clicking the project and selecting 'Build.'  This should create a file
  called libGyroKalman.a under the Release directory.  
  
TARGET APPLICATION PROJECT SETUP:

  This library can be used in eclipse C++ projects of type 'AVR Cross Target
  Application,' using the 'AVR-GCC' toolchain.
  
  In order to use this library in a target application project, this library
  file and the avrfix library must be linked into the build.  To do 
  this, right click the project and select Properties.  Then, expand the 'C/C++ 
  build' submenu on the left and click on 'Settings.'  In the 
  right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand the 'AVR C++ Linker' 
  submenu and click on 'Libraries.'  In the 'Libraries (-l)' box on the right, 
  add the two libraries, called GyroKalman and avrfix 
  (or whatever library is needed for your board).  Note that you should NOT 
  enter the prefix 'lib' at the beginning, or the extension '.a' at the end of 
  these names.  Also, ensure the GyroKalman library is listed above the avrfix 
  library.  In the 'Libraries Path (-L)' box on the lower right, add the
  paths to the two libraries.  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 
  'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and the full repository is checked 
  out including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p microcontroller:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/GyroKalman/Release"
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
  
  The target application project will also need to have include paths set up to
  find the avrfix.h header file, and the GyroKalman.h header file.  To do this,
  follow the same instructions as the above section for adding include paths in
  the library project setup.  This time, ensure paths to both the avrfix.h
  and to this library are provided.  If your eclipse workspace is located at 
  the top 'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and the full repository is 
  checked out including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p library:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/GyroKalman"
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
  
  Finally, ensure that any source file in your target application project which
  uses functions from this library first includes the library header file using:
  #include "GyroKalman.h"
