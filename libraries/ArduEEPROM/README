LIBRARY NAME:

  ArduEEPROM

DESCRIPTION:

  This ArduEEPROM project creates a static library which can be used to 
  read or write to the EEPROM device on an Arduino with EEPROM.  It provides
  basic functions which can be used to handle reading/writing data from/to
  the EEPROM contained in the AVR microcontrollers.
  
  The read and write functions have blocking and non-blocking function call
  options.  The blocking ones will continuously poll to see when the EEPROM is
  available, and then perform the read or write.  This will ensure the read or
  write occurs, but results in wasted processor time while waiting.  The non-
  blocking functions will just poll once, and perform the read or write only
  if the device is ready.  This prevents wasted processor time while waiting 
  for the device to be ready, but does not ensure that the read or write will
  actually take place.
  
  Applications that require interrupt-controlled EEPROM access 
  to ensure that no time will be wasted in spinloops, while ensuring the 
  read/write operations do occur will have to deploy their 
  own implementation.

DEPENDENCIES:

  When used in a target application project, this library also requires that
  the arduino board support library is linked as well.  For instance, the
  ATmega328p chip on the ArduPilot or Duemilanove board requires linking the 
  Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328 library in addition to this ArduEEPROM one.
  
LIBRARY PROJECT SETUP:

  This project was created using Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers (version
  4.4.1), with the AVR Eclipse plugin (version 2.4.1) installed.
  
  To create this project, click on File->New->C++ Project... and then enter
  ArduEEPROM as the project name and select the directory containing this 
  README file as the project location.  Assuming you have checked this out from
  a local git repository cloned from https://github.com/pmrancuret/Arduino, 
  this path should be <YourPathToGitRepoLoc>\Arduino\libraries\ArduEEPROM.  
  
  Then, under 'Project Type', select 'Empty Project' under the 'AVR Cross 
  Target Static Library' type, and ensure AVR-GCC is selected as the toolchain.  
  Click 'Next', then un-select the 'Debug' build configuration if you don't use
  it, and click 'Next' again.  Finally, enter the correct processor type and 
  clock speed you are using, and click Finish.  For the ArduPilot board, the
  processor type is ATmega328p, and the clock speed is 16000000.
  
  Once the project is created, ensure the path for finding the Arduino.h file
  is added.  To do this, right click the project and select Properties.  Then, 
  expand the C/C++ build submenu on the left and click on 'Settings.'  In the 
  right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand both the 'AVR Compiler' and
  the 'AVR C++ Compiler' submenus.  Under each of these, select Directories, 
  then click the 'Add...' button at the top right (with the green + sign).  In
  this dialog, enter the path to the directory containing the Arduino.h file.
  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' folder of this
  git repository, and the full repository is checked out including libraries, 
  then the following path should work for the ATmega328p library:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  Once this project has been set up correctly, the library can be built by
  right clicking the project and selecting 'Build.'  This should create a file
  called libArduEEPROM.a under the Release directory.  
  
TARGET APPLICATION PROJECT SETUP:

  This library can be used in eclipse C++ projects of type 'AVR Cross Target
  Application,' using the 'AVR-GCC' toolchain.
  
  In order to use this library in a target application project, this library
  file and the Arduino support library must be linked into the build.  To do 
  this, right click the project and select Properties.  Then, expand the 'C/C++ 
  build' submenu on the left and click on 'Settings.'  In the 
  right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand the 'AVR C++ Linker' 
  submenu and click on 'Libraries.'  In the 'Libraries (-l)' box on the right, 
  add the two libraries, called ArduEEPROM and Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328 
  (or whatever library is needed for your board).  Note that you should NOT 
  enter the prefix 'lib' at the beginning, or the extension '.a' at the end of 
  these names.  Also, ensure the ArduEEPROM library is listed above the Arduino 
  board library.  In the 'Libraries Path (-L)' box on the lower right, add the
  paths to the two libraries.  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 
  'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and the full repository is checked 
  out including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p microcontroller:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduEEPROM/Release"
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  The target application project will also need to have include paths set up to
  find the Arduino.h header file, and the ArduEEPROM.h header file.  To do this,
  follow the same instructions as the above section for adding include paths in
  the library project setup.  This time, ensure paths to both the Arduino.h
  and to this library are provided.  If your eclipse workspace is located at 
  the top 'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and the full repository is 
  checked out including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p library:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduEEPROM"
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  Finally, ensure that any source file in your target application project which
  uses functions from this library first includes the library header file using:
  #include "ArduEEPROM.h"
