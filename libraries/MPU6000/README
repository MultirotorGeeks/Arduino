DESCRIPTION:

  This MPU6000 project provides the ability to communicate with the MPU6000 
  3-axis gyro/accelerometer chip on the ArduPilot board.
  
  See the header file MPU6000.h for descriptions of each of the public 
  functions provided in the MPU6000 class, and how they are used.

DEPENDENCIES:

  avrfix
  SPI
  Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328
  
LIBRARY PROJECT SETUP:

  This project was created using Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers (version
  4.4.1), with the AVR Eclipse plugin (version 2.4.1) installed.
  
  To create this project, click on File->New->C++ Project... and then enter
  GyroKalman as the project name and select the directory containing this 
  README file as the project location.  Assuming you have checked this out from
  a local git repository cloned from https://github.com/pmrancuret/Arduino, 
  this path should be <YourPathToGitRepoLoc>\Arduino\libraries\MPU6000.  
  
  Then, under 'Project Type', select 'Empty Project' under the 'AVR Cross 
  Target Static Library' type, and ensure AVR-GCC is selected as the toolchain.  
  Click 'Next', then un-select the 'Debug' build configuration if you don't use
  it, and click 'Next' again.  Finally, enter the correct processor type and 
  clock speed you are using, and click Finish.  For the ArduPilot board, the
  processor type is ATmega328p, and the clock speed is 16000000.
  
  Once the project is created, ensure the path for finding the avrfix.h, 
  Arduino.h, and SPI.h files are specified.  To do this, right click the 
  project and select Properties.  Then, expand the C/C++ build submenu on the 
  left and click on 'Settings.'  In the right side, under the 'Tool Settings' 
  tab, expand both the 'AVR Compiler' and the 'AVR C++ Compiler' submenus.  
  Under each of these, select Directories, then click the 'Add...' button at 
  the top right (with the green + sign).  In this dialog, enter the path to the 
  directory containing the avrfix.h, Arduino.h, and SPI.h files.
  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' folder of this
  git repository, and the full repository is checked out including libraries, 
  then the following path should work for the libraries:
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/SPI"
  
  Once this project has been set up correctly, the library can be built by
  right clicking the project and selecting 'Build.'  This should create a file
  called libMPU6000.a under the Release directory.  
  
TARGET APPLICATION PROJECT SETUP:

  This library can be used in eclipse C++ projects of type 'AVR Cross Target
  Application,' using the 'AVR-GCC' toolchain.
  
  In order to use this library in a target application project, this library
  file, the avrfix library file, the SPI library file, and the Arduino library
  file must all be linked into the build.  To do this, right click the project 
  and select Properties.  Then, expand the 'C/C++ build' submenu on the left 
  and click on 'Settings.'  In the right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, 
  expand the 'AVR C++ Linker' submenu and click on 'Libraries.'  In the 
  'Libraries (-l)' box on the right, add the four libraries, called MPU6000, 
  avrfix, SPI, and Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328 (or whatever library is 
  needed for your board).  Note that you should NOT enter the prefix 'lib' at 
  the beginning, or the extension '.a' at the end of these names.  Also, ensure 
  the MPU6000 library is listed above the avrfix, SPI, and 
  Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328 libraries.  In the 'Libraries Path (-L)' box 
  on the lower right, add the paths to the four libraries.  If your eclipse 
  workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and 
  the full repository is checked out including libraries, then the following 
  paths should work for the ATmega328p microcontroller:
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/MPU6000/Release"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/SPI/Release"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  The target application project will also need to have include paths set up to
  find the avrfix.h, SPI.h, and Arduino.h header files.  To do this, follow
  the same instructions as the above section for adding include paths in
  the library project setup.  This time, ensure the path to this library is
  also provided.  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' 
  folder of this git repository, and the full repository is checked out 
  including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p library:
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/MPU6000"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/avrfix"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/SPI"
    "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  Finally, ensure that any source file in your target application project which
  uses functions from this library first includes the library header file using:
    #include "MPU6000.h"
