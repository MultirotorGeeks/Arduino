LIBRARY NAME:

  ArduPilotBoardSupport
  
AUTHOR:

  Arduino Supplied Library and Header Files

DESCRIPTION:

  This directory contains the libArduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328.a file,
  which is a static library providing Arduino functions for the ATmega328p
  microcontroller.  Also, the necessary header files are included.

DEPENDENCIES:

  None
  
TARGET APPLICATION PROJECT SETUP:

  This library can be used in eclipse C++ projects of type 'AVR Cross Target
  Application,' using the 'AVR-GCC' toolchain.
  
  In order to use this library in a target application project, this 
  Arduino support library must be linked into the build.  To do 
  this, right click the project and select Properties.  Then, expand the 'C/C++ 
  build' submenu on the left and click on 'Settings.'  In the 
  right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand the 'AVR C++ Linker' 
  submenu and click on 'Libraries.'  In the 'Libraries (-l)' box on the right, 
  add the library, called Arduino_Duemilanove_w__ATmega328.  Note that you 
  should NOT enter the prefix 'lib' at the beginning, or the extension '.a' at 
  the end of these names.  In the 'Libraries Path (-L)' box on the lower right, 
  add the path to the library.  If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 
  'Arduino' folder of this git repository, and the full repository is checked 
  out including libraries, then the following paths should work for the 
  ATmega328p microcontroller:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  The target application project will also need to have include paths set up to
  find the Arduino.h header file.  To do this, right click the project and 
  select Properties.  Then, expand the C/C++ build submenu on the left and click 
  on 'Settings.'  In the right side, under the 'Tool Settings' tab, expand both 
  the 'AVR Compiler' and the 'AVR C++ Compiler' submenus.  Under each of these, 
  select Directories, then click the 'Add...' button at the top right (with the 
  green + sign).  In this dialog, enter the path to the directory containing the 
  Arduino.h file. If your eclipse workspace is located at the top 'Arduino' 
  folder of this git repository, and the full repository is checked out including 
  libraries, then the following path should work for the ATmega328p library:
  "${workspace_loc}/libraries/ArduPilotBoardSupport"
  
  Finally, ensure that any source file in your target application project which
  uses functions from this library first includes the library header file using:
  #include "ArduRadios.h"
